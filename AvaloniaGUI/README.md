GUI for the [FFcollection](https://github.com/TcPirate1/FFTCG_collection)

## TODO
Start with one page. Can Add additional pages later.

- Start with menu page. This is just designing and modifying UI.
- Connect to MongoDB. Setup environment variables to prevent accidental exposure.
- Read, Add, Edit, Delete (in this order)
- Tabs for opening new windows
